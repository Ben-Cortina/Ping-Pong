Description
    This program is a modified version of a remake of, the popular Atari game,
“Pong.” The difference between this version of pong and the supplied remake include,
new paddle graphics and effects, a new ball, a new background, new font, font
shadows, sound effects, background music, increased score cap, and credits to the
creator of this program and author of the background music.
    In Pong, each player has a paddle which they move up and down. There is a ball
that bounces off any surface it touches. Points are scored when the ball touches the
right or left side of the game window. The goal for each player is to prevent the ball from
touching the wall behind their paddle. This is done by using the paddle to block the ball
and reverse its direction. As added challenge, the ball speeds up each time it hits a
paddle. The balls initial speed and direction is random. The game ends when the score
limit is reached (100 in this version)
